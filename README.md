## What is this?

This package provides a web service like interface to *The Orderbook DEX* on-chain data.

To remain **decentralized** the web app should not depend on a centralized provider of data. This package reads on-chain data through an ethereum provider (EIP-1193) and provides it using an interface that is closer to what a web app would expect from a web service.
